The data portal DDI on Rails accompanies researchers throughout the entire
course of their research projects from conception to publication/citation.

The system offers researchers the possibility to explore the data, to compile
personalized datasets, and to publish results on the publication database.

In contrast to similar products, DDI on Rails is study-independent and
open-source, is able to document data with multiple versions/distributions and
the specific characteristics of a longitudinal study, and is easy to use.

if you want to contribute to this project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Follow the installation instructions for Docker and Docker-Compose:

- <https://docs.docker.com/install/>
- <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>

To verify the installation was successful, you can type:

```bash
$ docker --version
Docker version 18.09.5, ...
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.24.0, ...
```

### Installing

#### Development Environment

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ddionrails/ddionrails.git
cd ddionrails/
```

If you want to save yourself some typing you can create a symbolic link from
docker-compose.override.yml

```bash
ln -s  docker-compose-remote-dev.yml docker-compose.override.yml
```

Now you can start your services with

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

docker-compose implicitly uses the `docker-compose.override.yml` in addition to
the `docker-compose.yml` if it is present.
Without the symbolic link you would need to specify all docker-compose files:

```bash
docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" -f "docker-compose-remote-dev.yml" up -d
```

Using Visual Studio Code will make the process even simpler.
Just open the project after installing the
[remote development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
plugin.
VSCode will prompt you to reopen it in the
development container.
When confirmed, VSCode will set up all services for development through `docker-compose`.

With the basic setup the development container will be available at `localhost`.

:warning: **Warning** Do not use this in production the settings used by
the dev compose files are not secure.
This is also the reason why there is no docker-compose.override.yml
provided with the repository. These settings should not accidentally find their
way into production.

#### Production Environment

**Before** starting the services via docker-compose:

- \[Optional\] Benchmark your docker setup with
  [docker-bench-security](https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security).

  - Some of the changes needed to secure your docker setup might lead 
    to loss of containers and volumes. It would be better to make the
    changes before creating any containers on the system.

- Customize the environment files in docker/environments/
  and rename them to remove example from their name.

  - database.env should contain secure password.
  - django.env should be set up for production or staging

    - DJANGO_DEBUG should always be False for Production
    - DJANGO_SECRET_KEY should be long and random
    - ALLOWED_HOSTS should match your setup

- Uncomment the environment blocks in the
  docker-compose file to load the environment files.
- Or create a docker-compose.override.yml file that sets
  the environment files.
- Customize the docker/nginx/nginx.example.conf and rename it to nginx.conf.

  - Sections that need to be changed are marked with `REPLACE_ME`
  - For ssl change your docker-compose.yml or docker-compose.override.yml
    to mount cert and key at the right location.

    - If you use a ca-chain file, add this file to the end of your crt file.
      This file can then be used by nginx as certificate.

- \[Optional\] Set up a backup routine for the database.

### Importing Data

To import a study's metadata into the system, you need a git repository
containing a couple of .csv and .json files (e.g. <https://github.com/ddionrails/testsuite/tree/master/ddionrails>).

You need to add your study to the system by invoking the `add` command:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py add soep-test github.com/ddionrails/testsuite
```

You clone or pull the repository with `update`:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py update soep-test
```

Your study's metadata gets inserted into the database by adding import jobs onto
a Redis queue (this can take some time). The last job includes indexing all
metadata into the Elasticsearch indices.

Summary:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py add soep-test github.com/ddionrails/testsuite
docker-compose exec web python manage.py update
```

## Running the tests

To run the unit and integration tests you can call `paver test`.
This does not run functional tests with Selenium.

```bash
cd ddionrails/
docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" -f "docker-compose-dev.yml" up -d
docker-compose exec web paver test
```
