  instead of after all import jobs.

  - UUIDs are either generated from a base UUID and the content of the fields
    that make a row unique or from the UUID of the "parent" model and the  
    unique fields.

  - Numeric ids which were used until now are incompatible with the new UUID field.
    This breaking change was used as an opportunity to reset all migrations and
    start from a clean slate.
